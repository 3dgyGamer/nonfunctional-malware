# ACCESS GAINER

stolen some scripts

use pymem to move payload to a memory (?)

not tested

sends a reverse tcp shell 

put in the ngrok tcp address after starting up ngrok into the payload

encrypt payload to AES / XOR then base64

paste script into code of the file

works maybe with meterpreter

send it and try it out on a test computer (?)
